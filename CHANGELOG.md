# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Until the
first release, entries accumulate under **Unreleased**; dates mark when a change landed on
`main`. The protocol document, the hub, and each plugin will be versioned independently
(SemVer) once implementation starts, and this file will gain per-artifact sections at that
point if needed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 2026-08-15: `spec/protocol.md` draft 0.1, the public normative protocol specification
  (RFC 2119): transport, envelope, enrollment and sessions, manifest, action lifecycle,
  telemetry and state, delivery guarantees, admin authorization and audit, webhooks, KV
  store, versioning, conformance. Three unresolved items are marked inline as open
  pre-1.0 questions (poll timeout floor, player identity platform registry, snapshot
  diffs).
- 2026-08-15: standard repository documents: README, LICENSE (Apache-2.0, per design
  decision D-001), CONTRIBUTING (including the binding clean-room provenance policy),
  SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.
- 2026-08-15: repository initialized on branch `main`.

### Changed

- 2026-08-15: adopted the platform-qualified player identity shape
  (`{ "platform": "...", "id": "..." }`) in the protocol body and examples; previously it
  was only listed as an open question.
